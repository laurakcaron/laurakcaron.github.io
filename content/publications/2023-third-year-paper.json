  "abstract": "Between 1949 and 1980, every U.S. state mandated public schools to provide educational services for disabled students—one of the largest education reforms in U.S. history—but little is known about the impacts of this. This paper estimates the mandates' effects by compiling survey and administrative datasets and using variation in the mandates' timing. The mandates sharply increased the services received by disabled students and preschool enrollments. In adulthood, disabled individuals affected by the mandates attained an additional 0.23 years of education, were 2.9 percentage points more likely to have work experience, and were less likely to receive Social Security benefits for those unable to work. Although a concern about this policy is that redirecting resources might be zero-sum, education and employment also increased for non-disabled individuals. The size of these effects aligns with evidence that the mandates increased spending per student by up to 15%. Families also changed: the mandates increased employment of mothers of disabled children and the probability that disabled individuals headed their own households in adulthood. Over the long term, the mandates pay for themselves by generating government revenues in excess of their cost. This paper highlights the large, broad-based benefits of expanding education for disabled students."
