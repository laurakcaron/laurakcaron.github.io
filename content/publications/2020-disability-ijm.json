  "abstract": "This paper quantifies the labor market outcomes of people with disabilities (PwD) in Indonesia and compares them to people without disabilities. It distinguishes between medically-diagnosed disabilities and lived-experience disabilities to understand differences in access to diagnosis. This paper finds compelling evidence that, where a wage penalty exists, a substantial part is unexplained by observable characteristics.",
