  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic placed new constraints and prices on commuting to work around the world. However, traditional methods of measuring household welfare (and, accordingly, poverty and inequality) based on expenditures or consumption have not taken into consider the implications of these changes. We propose a new method to impute transportation cost equivalents for household consumption or expenditure aggregates. First, we outline the theory showing significant mis-measurement of welfare for households who are able to shift into remote work during the pandemic. We show that taking transportation costs into account has important implications for evaluating the impacts of the pandemic.",
