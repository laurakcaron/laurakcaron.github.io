  "abstract": "Beliefs about what employers want may affect job seekers' labor market outcomes. Partnering with a large, mid-tier public university in the Southeastern U.S., we conduct incentivized, pre-registered experiments on both employers and job-seeking students to examine: (1) how employers evaluate candidate characteristics, (2) whether (and which) students accurately understand employer preferences, and (3) how those student beliefs relate to their job search outcomes. We find that employers value GPA and previous work experience, and we add novel systematic evidence that employers rely on information about extracurricular activities, primarily to judge candidates' non-cognitive skills. Students, however, generally misunderstand employer preferences, generally overestimating the role of professional internships and academics, and underestimating the role of extracurriculars and the number of work experiences. This miscalibration is particularly pronounced among disadvantaged students, including first-generation college students and nonwhite students. Incorrect beliefs are linked to fewer interviews and lower wage offers. Leveraging innovative methodological approaches, our findings establish new evidence on the extent, heterogeneity, and implications of information quality among job seekers, and inform current discourse on higher education and economic mobility.",
