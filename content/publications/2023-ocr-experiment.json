  "abstract": "Job seekers often try to anticipate employers' preferences for job applicants, but we know little about how well they understand these preferences. We partner with a large, mid-tier public university in the Southeastern U.S. to conduct incentivized, pre-registered experiments on both employers and job-seeking students to examine: (1) how employers evaluate candidate characteristics, (2) whether (and which) students accurately understand employer preferences, and (3) how those student beliefs relate to their job search outcomes. We find that employers value GPA and previous work experience, and we add novel systematic evidence that employers rely on information about extracurricular activities, primarily to judge candidates' non-cognitive skills. Students, however, tend to misunderstand employer preferences, generally overestimating the role of professional internships and academics and underestimating the role of extracurriculars and the number of work experiences. Incorrect beliefs are linked to lower wage offers, suggesting that poor information quality is associated with worse job outcomes. This work introduces new methodological approaches to provide evidence on information quality among job seekers, with important implications for the design of interventions to reduce information frictions in the job search process.",
