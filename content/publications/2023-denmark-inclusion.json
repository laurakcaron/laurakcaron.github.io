  "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of mainstreaming special education students into general education classrooms, a practice which may reduce costs per student but which some fear can cause negative spillovers for classroom peers. This paper investigates the role of peers' reactions to mainstreaming and how these matter for inferring effects on other student outcomes such as attendance, socioemotional well-being, and academic performance. Our analysis uses Danish administrative data which allows us to map students to classrooms and follow them over time. Using a difference-in-difference design, we show that the arrival of a mainstreamed student induces school switching among peers, with increases of 11% in the probability of switching schools in a given year. These students tend to switch into private schools and schools where peers have a high socioeconomic background. We show that, when estimating impacts on students' outcomes, the bias generated by not accounting for this switching may be large. Our results suggest that mainstreaming disabled students can have large, potentially unintended, general equilibrium effects due to other students' reactions. ",
