  "abstract": "Prior work has shown that placing disabled students in classrooms with non-disabled peers (“mainstreaming”) can have negative impacts on these peers, but has not fully considered the role of student mobility in understanding these impacts. Using Danish administrative data and a difference-in-difference design, we show that the arrival of a mainstreamed student in a classroom makes peers 11% more likely to switch schools in a given year. Because school switching is selective, failing to account for this when estimating peer effects may introduce substantial biases. To isolate the direct impacts of the arrival of a mainstreamed student from the indirect impacts of school switching, we study a sizeable—although potentially selected—subgroup of students who never change schools. For this subgroup, we find little evidence that the arrival of a mainstreamed student causes negative effects on attendance, test scores, or social tensions in the class. In contrast, students who do change schools experience negative impacts, which may be due either to the arrival of a mainstreamed student or the disruption caused by switching schools. These results highlight that research and policy on the inclusion of disabled students in classrooms must account for the role of student mobility in shaping outcomes.  ",
