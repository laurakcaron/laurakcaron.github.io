  "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of mainstreaming special education students into general education classrooms. It specifically focuses on how mainstreaming is associated with classroom composition changes and how this matters for inferring other relevant outcomes such as absence, well-being, and academic performance. We use Danish registry data which allows us to map students to classrooms and follow them over time. Using a difference-in-difference design, we demonstrate that mainstreaming special education students induces school switching among peers, and students switch especially towards private schools. Additionally, we consider the impact of mainstreaming on peers' academic and socioemotional wellbeing in all schools and in isolated schools were switching is limited. We also conduct bounding exercises on attrition to private schools. We conclude that it is important to consider school switching when trying to understand the impacts of mainstreaming students. More generally, the results of this paper suggest that general equilibrium effects are likely large with regard to sorting when trying to mainstream special education students.",
