  "abstract": "Prior work has shown that placing disabled students in classrooms with non-disabled peers\n(“mainstreaming”) can have negative impacts on these peers, but has not fully considered the\nrole of student mobility in understanding these impacts. Using Danish administrative data\nand a difference-in-difference design, we show that the arrival of a mainstreamed student in\na classroom makes peers 11% more likely to switch schools in a given year. Because school\nswitching is selective by socio-economic background and choice of public versus private schools,\nthis may increase socio-economic segregation. We isolate the direct impacts of the arrival of\na mainstreamed student from the indirect impacts of school switching by studying a sizeable\n— although potentially selected — subgroup of students who never change schools. For this\nsubgroup, we find little evidence that the arrival of a mainstreamed student causes negative\neffects on attendance, test scores, or social tensions in the class. In contrast, students who do\nchange schools experience negative impacts, which may be due to direct effects from the arrival\nof a mainstreamed student or the indirect disruption caused by switching schools. Research and\npolicy on the inclusion of disabled students in classrooms must account for the role of student\nmobility in shaping outcomes.\n\n",
