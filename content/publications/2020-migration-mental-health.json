  "abstract": "We use survey data collected in 2017 to examine self-reports of depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and pain among domestic migrants, returned U.S. migrants, and non-migrants. Compared to domestic migrants, U.S. migrants are positively selected but these characteristics are not protective for them.",

  "alt": "A bar chart shows the Mental health conditions of U.S. and Mexican Migrants and Non-Migrants. The bars compare migrants to the US, migrants within Mexico, and non-migrants. Rates of depression are similar for all groups, between 5 and 6%. Rates of anxiety are significantly higher for migrants within Mexico, reaching 22.6% compared with 17.5% for nonmigrants. Rates of fatigue are also higher for migrants within Mexico (6.3%) as are rates of pain (7.1%). ",
