  "abstract": "Digital financial services (DFSs) may lower certain costs of accessing finance, but they bring new costs, including difficulties accessing mobile networks. Using the Demographic and Health Surveys and several geocoded databases in Nepal, the Philippines, Senegal and Tanzania, this paper studies the distribution of digital finance use among women and its enabling infrastructure, including mobile phone towers, compared to traditional finance. Mobile phone towers are more unequally distributed than traditional banks, though mobile phone use is near universal. The results suggest that old inequalities may constrain the promise of new digital technologies.",
