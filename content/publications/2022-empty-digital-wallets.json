  "abstract": "Digital financial services (DFSs) may lower certain costs of accessing finance, but they bring new costs, including difficulties accessing mobile networks. Mobile phone towers are more unequally distributed than traditional banks, though mobile phone use is near universal. The results suggest that old inequalities may constrain the promise of new digital technologies.",
