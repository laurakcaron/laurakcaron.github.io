  "alt": "A graph titled \"While remittances dropped sharply in the wake of COVID-19, in many LAC countries they recovered quickly and are now even outpacing 2019 flows. The graph shows percent changes relative to 2019 for several countries from January through December.",
  "abstract": "In the wake of COVID-19, analysts estimated that remittance flows (money sent home from migrant workers abroad) would face a steep decline. In late April, the World Bank projected an estimated 20% drop in remittances in 2020—which would have made it the “sharpest decline of remittances in recent history.” "
