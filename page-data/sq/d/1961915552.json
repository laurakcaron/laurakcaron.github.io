Mobile phone towers are more unequally distributed than traditional banks, though mobile phone use is near universal. The results suggest that old inequalities may constrain the promise of new digital technologies.","fulltextpdf":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ooec/odac001","pubtype":["journal","econ"],"pubweb":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ooec/odac001","date":"2022","alt":"Figure 4: Spatial patterns of mobile phone towers and mobile DFS use. The figure shows four maps labeled Nepal, Philippines, Senegal, and Tanzania, which display points representing the spread of mobile phone towers by type (GSM, UMTS, and LTE) compared with the percent of people using digital financial services in various clusters around each country."}},{"node":{"shorttitle":"Migration and Mental Health in Mexico: Domestic Migrants, Return U.S. Migrants, and Non-Migrants","authors":"Katharine Donato, Laura Caron, and Erin Hamilton","place":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","image":"images/migration-mental-health.jpg","abstract":"We use survey data collected in 2017 to examine self-reports of depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and pain among domestic migrants, returned U.S. migrants, and non-migrants. Compared to domestic migrants, U.S. migrants are positively selected but these characteristics are not protective for them.","fulltextpdf":null,"pubtype":["nonecon","journal"],"pubweb":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00970/full","date":"2020","alt":"A bar chart shows the Mental health conditions of U.S. and Mexican Migrants and Non-Migrants. The bars compare migrants to the US, migrants within Mexico, and non-migrants. Rates of depression are similar for all groups, between 5 and 6%. Rates of anxiety are significantly higher for migrants within Mexico, reaching 22.6% compared with 17.5% for nonmigrants. Rates of fatigue are also higher for migrants within Mexico (6.3%) as are rates of pain (7.1%).

It distinguishes between medically-diagnosed disabilities and lived-experience disabilities to understand differences in access to diagnosis. This paper finds compelling evidence that, where a wage penalty exists, a substantial part is unexplained by observable characteristics.","fulltextpdf":"","pubtype":["econ","journal"],"pubweb":"https://doi.org/10.1108/IJM-01-2020-0022","date":"2020","alt":"A diagram shows the overlap between different types of disabilities as measured in this project. Among medical disabilities, chronic illness is non-apparent, other mental disability is sometimes both apparent and non-apparent. Among disabilities that may be medical or lived-experience, depression is non-apparent, injuries may be apparent or non-apparent, and other physical disabilities are apparent. Among lived-experience disabilities, activity limitations are non-apparent."}}]}}}
