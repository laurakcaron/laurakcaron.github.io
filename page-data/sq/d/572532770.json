This is one of the largest education reforms in U.S. history, but little is known about its impacts. Given scarce data in this period, I compile survey and administrative datasets and set up a difference-in-difference design using variation in the mandates' timing. I show that the mandates increased both services for disabled students and preschool enrollments. In adulthood, disabled individuals below school age at a mandate's implementation became about 20% less likely to have no education, attained up to 0.23 more years of education, and were more likely to have worked. Although this policy could have taken away resources from non-disabled students, in fact, education and employment also increased for non-disabled individuals. These effects align with evidence that the mandates increased spending per student by up to 15%. Families were also impacted: the mandates increased employment among mothers of disabled children and the probability that disabled individuals became household heads. Over the long term, the mandates paid for themselves by generating government revenues in excess of their cost. These results provide new evidence on the large, broad impacts of expanding access to education for disabled students.","fulltextpdf":"../Caron_Public_Education_Disabled_Students.pdf","pubtype":["econ","jmp"],"pubweb":null,"date":"2025","alt":null,"slides":null,"presentedat":null,"mentionedin":null,"linkname":null}},{"node":{"shorttitle":"Triple Difference Designs with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects","authors":"","place":"","image":null,"abstract":"Triple difference designs have become increasingly popular in empirical economics. The advantage of a triple difference design is that, within treatment group, it allows for another subgroup of the population -- potentially less impacted by the treatment -- to serve as a control for the subgroup of interest. While literature on difference-in-differences has discussed heterogeneity in treatment effects between treated and control groups or over time, little attention has been given to the implications of heterogeneity in treatment effects between subgroups. In this paper, I show that interpretation of the usual triple difference parameter of interest, the difference in average treatment effects on the treated between subgroups, may be affected by this kind of heterogeneity. I propose a new parameter of interest, the causal difference in average treatment effects on the treated, which makes causal comparisons between subgroups. I discuss assumptions for identification and derive the semiparametric efficiency bounds for this parameter. I then propose doubly-robust, efficient estimators for this parameter. I use a simulation study to highlight the desirable finite-sample properties of these estimators, as well as to show the difference between this parameter and the usual triple difference parameter of interest. An empirical application shows the importance of considering treatment effect heterogeneity in practical applications.

Peer Impacts of Moving Disabled Students to General Education Classrooms","authors":"with Jesper Eriksen and Jeppe Johansen","place":"","image":null,"abstract":"Prior work has shown that placing disabled students in classrooms with non-disabled peers (“mainstreaming”) can have negative impacts on these peers, but has not fully considered the role of student mobility in understanding these impacts. Using Danish administrative data and a difference-in-difference design, we show that the arrival of a mainstreamed student in a classroom makes peers 11% more likely to switch schools in a given year. Because school switching is selective, failing to account for this when estimating peer effects may introduce substantial biases. To isolate the direct impacts of the arrival of a mainstreamed student from the indirect impacts of school switching, we study a sizeable—although potentially selected—subgroup of students who never change schools. For this subgroup, we find little evidence that the arrival of a mainstreamed student causes negative effects on attendance, test scores, or social tensions in the class. In contrast, students who do change schools experience negative impacts, which may be due either to the arrival of a mainstreamed student or the disruption caused by switching schools. These results highlight that research and policy on the inclusion of disabled students in classrooms must account for the role of student mobility in shaping outcomes.

We partner with a large, mid-tier public university in the Southeastern U.S. to conduct incentivized, pre-registered experiments on both employers and job-seeking students to examine: (1) how employers evaluate candidate characteristics, (2) whether (and which) students accurately understand employer preferences, and (3) how those student beliefs relate to their job search outcomes. We find that employers value GPA and previous work experience, and we add novel systematic evidence that employers rely on information about extracurricular activities, primarily to judge candidates' non-cognitive skills. Students, however, tend to misunderstand employer preferences, generally overestimating the role of professional internships and academics and underestimating the role of extracurriculars and the number of work experiences. Incorrect beliefs are linked to lower wage offers, suggesting that poor information quality is associated with worse job outcomes. This work introduces new methodological approaches to provide evidence on information quality among job seekers, with important implications for the design of interventions to reduce information frictions in the job search process.","fulltextpdf":null,"pubtype":["econ","wp"],"pubweb":"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/9574","date":"2025","alt":null,"slides":null,"presentedat":null,"mentionedin":null,"linkname":"AEA RCT Registry"}},{"node":{"shorttitle":"Women, Men, and Polya Urns. Underrepresentation at Equal Talent in the Absence of Discrimination","authors":"with Alessandra Casella and Victoria Mooers","place":"","image":null,"abstract":"In a world where the majority and the minority group have equal distributions of talent, where candidates are objectively and accurately evaluated, and no discrimination occurs, the underrepresentation of the minority group in prestigious positions is nonetheless highly sticky. If the sample of candidates from the minority group is numerically smaller, at equal distribution of talent, the most qualified candidate is more likely to belong to the majority sample, mirroring its larger numerical size. If future samples of candidates respond to the realized selection in the expected direction—increasing if the selection came from the sample, decreasing or increasing less if it did not—the higher probability of success in the majority sample will persist. We capture this process with a well-known statistical model: the Polya urn. The richness of existing results and the streamlined model allow us to study and compare different policy interventions. Two robust results are that temporary affirmative action interventions have long-term equalizing effects, and that any decline in the quality of selected candidates is self-correcting, even while the intervention lasts.
